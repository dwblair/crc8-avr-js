# Demo

**crc8.ino**, if loaded onto an Arduino board, will generate the appropriate CRC8 checksum for a given string input and choice of CRC8 input polynomial, and prints it to the serial port.

**crc8.js**, loaded into **index.html**, logs the CRC8 checkum for a given string input and choice of CRC8 polynomial, and logs it to console.log.

Using same string inputs and polynomials, this might be useful for seeing whether a string generated on the Arduino has been communicated successfully to browser.
